# 🚀 C# Fullstack Roadmap (12 Weeks)

Welcome! 👋  
This repo is a structured 12-week self-paced program to learn **C# and .NET** for fullstack development — inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), but tailored for C# learners.  

By the end of 12 weeks, you’ll have:
- A strong grasp of **C# fundamentals & OOP**
- Experience with **ASP.NET Core APIs**
- A working knowledge of **Entity Framework & SQL**
- A frontend app built with **Blazor (or React)**
- **Fullstack deployed projects** in your portfolio
- The confidence to **apply for junior/mid-level .NET roles**
